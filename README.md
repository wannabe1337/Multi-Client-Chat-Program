**About**<br/>
A simple text based multi-client chat program. To test the program, first run the server program then run the client program and join the chatroom using a '_SECRET_' password.<br/>I have applied the concept of _Multithreading_ , _Socket-Programming_ and _Exception-Handling_ to build this small project.
